## Requirements

create Python 3.7 environment (conda create -n top2vec_env python==3.7)

Activate the environment (conda activate top2vec_env)

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Check The Feasibility
To check the feasibility of the code

Run python top2vec_inference.py

Output of above command will create test_out.csv file and a logger file.(refer output folder and logs folder)

Follow top2vec_inference.py file to know the inference pipeline of top2vec.

## Refer below file for Analysis
Use utility_top2vec.ipynb file for your complete analysis(jupyter notebook file)
